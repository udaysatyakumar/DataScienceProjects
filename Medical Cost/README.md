Medical Cost Prediction
A Machine Learning Project for Predicting Medical Expenses

Overview
This project builds a predictive model to estimate medical insurance costs based on key patient attributes such as age, BMI, smoking status, and region. The goal is to help healthcare providers and insurance companies assess risk and pricing.

Key Features
âœ… Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding feature relationships and correlations
âœ… Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature engineering, and scaling
âœ… Machine Learning Models: Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost
âœ… Model Evaluation: Mean Squared Error (MSE), RÂ²-score
âœ… Deployment: Flask API for real-time cost predictions
