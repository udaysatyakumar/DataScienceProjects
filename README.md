This repository contains two end-to-end Data Science projects: 
1) Network Security Threat Detection      
2) Student Performance Prediction      
   
showcasing machine learning applications in cybersecurity and education. 

The Network Security Threat Detection project focuses on identifying potential security threats in network traffic using classification models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting. It involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, model evaluation, and deployment using Docker and AWS, ensuring robust and scalable threat detection.   

The Student Performance Prediction project aims to analyze academic and socio-economic factors affecting student performance, using Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost models. The project covers data collection, preprocessing, feature selection, and model evaluation, providing insights into key predictors of academic success. A user-friendly Flask/Streamlit application is included for interactive predictions, making it a practical solution for educators and institutions. Both projects emphasize best practices in data science, including structured workflows, automation with GitHub Actions, and cloud-based deployment.
