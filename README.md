# Network Security Project 📊🚀  
This repository contains end-to-end **Data Science & Machine Learning** projects, showcasing various aspects of **data preprocessing, feature engineering, model building, evaluation, and deployment**.  

## 📁 Projects Overview  
### 1️⃣ **Network Security** 🔐  
**Objective**: Detect phishing attacks and classify network security threats using **Machine Learning** techniques.  

#### 🔹 **Project Workflow**  
✅ Data Collection: Network traffic and phishing data sources  
✅ Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical features  
✅ Feature Engineering: Selecting significant security-related features  
✅ Model Building: Training **Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting** models  
✅ Model Evaluation: **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score** for performance assessment  
✅ Deployment: Deploying the trained model using **AWS & Docker**
