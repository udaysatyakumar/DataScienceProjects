 StudentPerformance 🎓📈
 
Objective: Predict student performance based on various socio-economic and academic factors using Machine Learning.

🔹 Project Workflow

✅ Data Collection: Student scores and demographic details
✅ Data Preprocessing: Handling missing data, encoding categorical variables
✅ Feature Engineering: Selecting important features influencing student performance
✅ Model Building: Training Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost
✅ Model Evaluation: RMSE, R² score, MAE for performance measurement
✅ Deployment: Deploying the model using Flask & Streamlit
